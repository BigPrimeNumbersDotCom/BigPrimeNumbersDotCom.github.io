# Big Prime Numbers - for devs

You're probably asking yourself why do I experiment with my own site in such a Jekyll and Hyde way.
It's simply that the best and fastest way to understand anything is to test it on yourself. For example
a bodybuilder will take an exercise, e.g. Bench Press and alter their grip, hand position or body position to see
what effects the new exercise motion will trigger.

If it were not for these thought's then evolution of weight training or any disciple would ever advance. This is why my personal
site is like a cluttered science lab. The sheer volume of tweaks in the web-dev scope is probably near infinite
